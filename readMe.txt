Fire Alarm Data Logger - Python Project

This is a simple Python program that simulates a fire alarm sensor and logs temperature readings into a CSV file. It demonstrates the concept of data collection and storage using Python.

## Getting Started

To run this program, follow these steps:

1. **Prerequisites**: Make sure you have Python installed on your system. You can download it from https://www.python.org/downloads/.

2. **Clone or Download**: Clone this repository to your local machine or download the project as a ZIP file and extract it.

3. **Navigate to the Directory**: Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where you have the project files.

4. **Run the Program**: Execute the following command to run the program:

5. **Simulation**: The program will start simulating temperature readings from a fire alarm sensor and logging them into a CSV file named `fire_alarm_data.csv`.

6. **Termination**: To stop the program, press `Ctrl + C` in the terminal.

## Customization

You can customize this program to better suit your needs. Here are some things you might consider:

- **Real Data**: Replace the simulated sensor data in the `simulate_sensor()` function with actual data from your fire alarm sensor.

- **Logging Frequency**: Adjust the `time.sleep()` value to change how often the program logs data.

- **Data Format**: Modify the code in the `with open(...)` block to log additional data fields or change the CSV format.
